This is an obsolete repo for the microcluster project by the Colorado Printing Project, as current development has been moved to notabug.org following the buyout of guthub by microsoft. Unfortunately Github doesn't have a way to make this a mirrior for the active development repo, so please visit https://notabug.org/coloradoprintingproject/microcluster for up to date source.
